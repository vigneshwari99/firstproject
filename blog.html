          <p>A car is a road vehicle used to carry passengers.
             It is also called an automobile, which comes from
              the Greek word "auto" and the French word "mobile". This name means "self-moving", as
               cars do not need horses or other external sources of power to move. Cars usually have
                four wheels and get their power from an engine, though many new cars made today do not
                 have engines. Millions of cars were made during the 20th century.
